# Regex-Hypernym-Database

## Introduction
This project consists of two parts:
Part 1: Construct a database of hypernym relations.
Part 2: Discover a hypernym using a lemma.

## Part 1
find and aggregate hypernym relations that 
match the Hearst patterns
using regular expressions, and save them in a txt file that will look like:**
```
hypernym: hyponym1 (x), hyponym2 (x) ...
hypernym: hyponym1 (x), hyponym2 (x) ...
...
```
**where (x) corresponds to the number of occurrences of the relations (across all possible patterns) in the corpus.**
For each hypernym, the list of co-hyponyms are sorted according to (x) in descending order, for example as follows:
```
country: united kingdom (10), israel (9), japan (9)
```


## Part 2 
The functionality to search all the possible hypernyms of the input lemma and print them to the console as follows:
```
hypernym1: (x)
hypernym2: (x)
...
```
**where (x) corresponds to the number of occurrences of the relations
(across all possible patterns) in the corpus.**
The hypernyms are sorted in a descending order according to (x).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/LiavBurger/Regex-Hypernym-Database.git
    ```
2. Download the corpus from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11aVnX9r-k5iy2GafZd-o5lBBgeNRuFDN?usp=sharing)
3. Open the project from an IDE of your choice.
4. Create configuration with CreateHypernymDatabase or DiscoverHypernym as the Main Class and add two arguments as follows:

To use part 1 (CreateHypernymDatabase):
```
(1) the absolute path to the directory of the corpus and (2) the path to the output file.
```

To use part 2 (DiscoverHypernym):
```
(1) the absolute path to the directory of the corpus and (2) a lemma.
```
